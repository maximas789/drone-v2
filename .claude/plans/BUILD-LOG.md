# Build Log

**What actually exists**, session by session. The [implementation plan](./implementation%20plan.md) is the spec; this file is the truth. Where they disagree, this file wins — then go and correct the plan.

Written for a **cleared context**. Assume the next session knows nothing except what's here.

---

## How to use this

**At the start of a session:** read this file top to bottom before touching code. The Pinned Versions table and the Open Threads section are the two that will bite you if skipped.

**At the end of a session, before `/clear`:** append an entry using the template at the bottom. Non-negotiable — an unwritten session is a session the next one will contradict.

**Rules for entries:**

- Record **deviations, not successes.** "Built F03 as specified" is one line. The column you added that isn't in the spec is five.
- Every deviation gets a **why**. A future session will otherwise "fix" it back.
- If you couldn't verify something, say so and say what it would need. Never write "works" for something you didn't run.
- Update the plan or the feature file when you deviate, and note here that you did.

## Pinned versions — from Wave 0 research

**Filled in by F01 and never guessed afterwards.** No version number goes anywhere in the codebase; this table exists so later waves don't re-research or invent one. Record what was verified against a primary source (the package's own docs, changelog, or the registry) versus what was inferred.

**Method:** `npm view <pkg> version` against the public registry on 2026-08-15 — the registry is the primary source for "what is current stable". Rows marked *installed* are what the lockfile actually resolved; rows marked *latest only* were researched for a later wave and are **not yet installed**.

| Package | Version found | Source | Notes / deprecations |
|---|---|---|---|
| next | 16.3.1 | registry · installed | Turbopack is the **default** bundler; `--turbopack` is no longer a `create-next-app` flag (`--rspack` is the opt-out). Ships `next typegen`. |
| react / react-dom | 19.2.8 | registry · installed | |
| typescript | 7.0.2 latest; **5.9.3 installed** | registry | `create-next-app` pins `^5`. TS 7 is the native port — deliberately not forced ahead of the framework. Revisit only if a wave needs it. |
| tailwindcss | 4.3.3 | registry · installed | v4, CSS-first config. No `tailwind.config.ts`. |
| eslint | 10.8.1 latest; **9.39.5 installed** | registry | `eslint-config-next@16.3.1` declares `eslint ^9`. Flat config either way. Do not force 10 until the Next config supports it. |
| eslint-config-next | 16.3.1 | registry · installed | Exports `eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals` and `/typescript` as flat-config arrays. |
| shadcn | 4.18.0 | registry · via `dlx` | CLI only, not a dependency. Detected Next.js + Tailwind v4 unaided. |
| vitest | 4.1.10 | registry · installed | |
| drizzle-orm | 0.45.2 | registry · latest only | F03 |
| drizzle-kit | 0.31.10 | registry · latest only | F03 |
| better-auth | 1.6.29 | registry · latest only | F05 |
| next-intl | 4.13.6 | registry · latest only | F02 |
| maplibre-gl | 6.3.0 | registry · latest only | F20 |
| terra-draw | 1.32.3 | registry · latest only | F23 |
| resend | 6.20.0 | registry · latest only | F06 |
| react-email | 6.9.2 | registry · latest only | F06 |
| @vercel/blob | 2.8.0 | registry · latest only | F07 |
| inngest | 4.18.1 | registry · latest only | F08 |
| zod | 4.4.3 | registry · latest only | Action input parsing |
| pg / postgres | 8.23.0 / 3.4.9 | registry · latest only | F03 picks the driver |
| qrcode | 1.5.4 | registry · latest only | F19 |

### Deprecations & API changes found

Anything a skill reference file got wrong, so it can be corrected and so no later wave repeats the mistake.

| Reference file | What it says | What's current | Action taken |
|---|---|---|---|
| `features/F01-project-shell.md` | `create-next-app … --turbopack` | Flag removed — Turbopack is the default in Next 16 | Dropped the flag. Feature file updated. |
| `features/F01-project-shell.md` | Scaffold into `.scaffold-tmp` | npm rejects a package name starting with `.` | Used `scaffold-tmp`. Feature file and `CLAUDE.md` updated. |
| `features/F01-project-shell.md` | `"dev": "next dev --turbopack"` | Turbopack is default; scaffold writes plain `next dev` | Left as the scaffold wrote it. Feature file updated. |
| `features/F01-project-shell.md` | `"typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"` | Next 16 generates `LayoutProps`/`PageProps` into `.next/types`; bare `tsc` fails on a clean tree | Script is `next typegen && tsc --noEmit`. Feature file updated. |

---

## Open threads

Things left unresolved that a later session must pick up. **Delete a row when it's closed** — a stale thread is worse than none.

| # | Thread | Raised in | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `.env` values the user must supply: `RESEND_API_KEY`, `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`, Inngest keys. All optional — the app must work without them. | Planning | Nothing; degraded paths are specified |
| 2 | `ID_HASH_PEPPER` and `RATE_LIMIT_PEPPER` must be generated once and never regenerated — changing the pepper orphans every existing hash. `.env` is currently **empty** — no pepper has been generated yet, so F09/F17 are the ones that create them. | Planning | F17, F09 |
| 3 | `pnpm test` runs with `--passWithNoTests` so Wave 0 could go green with zero tests. Once F10 lands the first domain test, **drop the flag** — otherwise a suite that silently stops being collected reads as a pass. | F01 | F10, F31 |
| 4 | Something else on this machine already occupies **port 3000** (it serves a next-intl app that 307s to `/ar` — not this project). `pnpm dev` fell through to 3001. Any URL, QR or `APP_URL` written assuming 3000 will point at the wrong app. | F01 | F19, F29 |

## Decisions made mid-build

Choices not in the plan, or that changed it. Each needs a reason a future session will accept.

| Date | Decision | Why | Plan updated? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-15 | Version research done inline against the npm registry, not by parallel sub-agents as F01 §"Version research" describes. | The session's operating rules forbid dispatching agents unless the user asks. The registry is the primary source the research was meant to reach, so the output is the same; only the mechanism differs. What was *not* done is the per-branch API/deprecation sweep — later waves must check current docs for their own package before writing against it. | Feature file updated |
| 2026-08-15 | Rule 1 also lints class strings inside `cva()`/`cn()`/`clsx()`/`twMerge()`, not only `className` attributes. | shadcn keeps its class strings in `cva()`. Restricting the rule to the attribute meant `button.tsx` and `badge.tsx` shipped `pr-`/`pl-` on day one, unflagged — in the components every future page reuses. | Feature file updated |
| 2026-08-15 | Kept the scaffold's generated `AGENTS.md`; our `CLAUDE.md` now ends with `@AGENTS.md`. | `next dev` rewrites `AGENTS.md` on every run — deleting it only produces a recurring uncommitted diff. The scaffold's own `CLAUDE.md` (a one-line `@AGENTS.md`) was deleted so the project's real one survived the move. | `CLAUDE.md` updated |
| 2026-08-15 | `vitest.config.ts` → `vitest.config.mts`. | Vite's incoming native config loader warns on ESM syntax in a file it treats as CJS. `.mts` is the fix that doesn't require `"type": "module"`, which would disturb the Next config files. | n/a |

## Verification status

What has actually been **run**, not what was written. F31 reads this.

| Check | Last run | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` | 2026-08-15 (F01) | ✅ clean — **requires `next typegen` first** on a clean tree; use `pnpm typecheck` |
| `pnpm lint` | 2026-08-15 (F01) | ✅ clean, and proven to **fail** on deliberate probes (see entry) |
| `pnpm build` | 2026-08-15 (F01) | ✅ compiled, 2 static routes (`/`, `/_not-found`) |
| `pnpm test` | 2026-08-15 (F01) | ✅ exit 0 — **zero tests**, passing only because of `--passWithNoTests` |
| `pnpm i18n:check` | — | — script does not exist yet (F02) |
| Two-account ownership | — | — |
| App with keys removed | — | — |
| End-to-end walkthrough (Arabic) | — | — |

### Known un-runnable

Named, never assumed. Add as discovered.

- Sending email to any address other than the account owner's — needs a verified domain in DNS.
- Vercel Blob uploads — needs a deployed store; the local driver is exercised instead.
- OG preview card as a third party sees it — needs a public domain.
- QR codes encoding a production URL — needs `APP_URL` on a real domain.
- Printed-QR scanning at 20 mm — needs a printer and a phone.
- Inngest production sync — needs a first deploy.

### Session 1 — Wave 0 · F01 Project Shell

**Date:** 2026-08-15
**Status:** ⚠️ done with deviations

**Built:**
- `git init -b main` in the project directory. `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` now prints `C:/Users/alsha/Desktop/drone-2-demo`. The parent home repo had **no** `.gitignore` at all — one was created containing `drone-2-demo/`.
- Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + ESLint, App Router, `src/`, `@/*` alias, pnpm. Scaffolded into `scaffold-tmp` and moved up; no nested project folder.
- shadcn/ui initialised; `button card input label badge` added.
- Vitest installed, `vitest.config.mts` with a `node` environment, `@` alias resolved, `include: src/**/*.test.ts`.
- `eslint.config.mjs` with all three rules — logical properties, no bare locale formatting, airspace purity. Each was **proved to fire** against a deliberate probe file, then the probes were deleted.
- `.env` (gitignored, effectively empty) and `.env.example` (committed) covering every key in plan §8 plus `RATE_LIMIT_PEPPER`.
- `src/app/page.tsx` replaced with a Wave-0 placeholder using shadcn `Card` + `Button`. `src/app/layout.tsx` left as the scaffold wrote it — F02 rewrites it.

**Deviated from spec:**
- **Version research was done inline against the npm registry, not by parallel sub-agents.** See Decisions. The consequence to carry forward: the *per-branch API and deprecation sweep* the spec asked for did **not** happen. Every later wave must check its own package's current docs before writing against it — the Pinned Versions table gives the version, not the API.
- **`--turbopack` dropped** from `create-next-app` (flag no longer exists; Turbopack is default in Next 16), so `dev` is plain `next dev`.
- **`.scaffold-tmp` → `scaffold-tmp`** — npm rejects a package name starting with a period.
- **`typecheck` is `next typegen && tsc --noEmit`**, not bare `tsc`. Next 16 generates the global `LayoutProps`/`PageProps` types into `.next/types`; on a fresh clone bare `tsc` fails with `TS2304: Cannot find name 'LayoutProps'` in `layout.tsx`. This will bite anyone who runs `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` directly, as several acceptance criteria say to.
- **`test` is `vitest run --passWithNoTests`** — see Open Thread 3; remove the flag when F10 adds the first test.
- **Rule 1 was widened to `cva()`/`cn()`/`clsx()`/`twMerge()` calls**, and shadcn's `button.tsx` / `badge.tsx` were corrected from `pr-`/`pl-` to `pe-`/`ps-`. Attribute-only linting let physical padding into the shared primitives untouched. The mapping is exact: those classes sit behind `has-data-[icon=inline-end]` / `inline-start`, so `pe-`/`ps-` is what was meant.
- `vitest.config.ts` → `.mts`; kept the scaffold's `AGENTS.md`. Both in Decisions.
- `shadcn init` added **`shadcn` itself to `dependencies`**, alongside `@base-ui/react`, `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `lucide-react`, `tailwind-merge`, `tw-animate-css`. Left exactly as the CLI wrote it — current shadcn expects to be resolvable from the project. Don't "clean it up" into devDependencies without checking the CLI still works. Note the primitives sit on **`@base-ui/react`**, not Radix.
- `.gitignore` gained `!.env.example` — the scaffold's `.env*` would otherwise have swallowed the committed template. `data/` deliberately **not** added yet; F07 owns it.

**Verified:**
- `pnpm lint` → clean. Then, on deliberate probe files: `className="ml-4 text-left rounded-lg border-l pr-2"` → 1 error; `toLocaleDateString('ar')` and `new Intl.NumberFormat` → 2 errors; the logical rewrite (`ms-4 text-start rounded-lg border-s pe-2 md:me-2`, plus a template literal) → clean, confirming **`rounded-lg` is not a false positive**; `src/lib/airspace/__probe.ts` importing `server-only`, `@/lib/db`, `next-intl` → 3 errors, while `src/lib/airspace/query.ts` importing `@/lib/db` → clean; `new Intl.DateTimeFormat` inside `src/lib/format.ts` → clean; `cva("base ml-2", …)` → 2 errors. All probes deleted; `pnpm lint` clean afterwards.
- `pnpm typecheck` → clean.
- `pnpm build` → compiled, `/` and `/_not-found` prerendered static.
- `pnpm test` → exit 0, "No test files found".
- `pnpm dev` → ready in ~0.9s; **`HTTP 200` on `http://localhost:3001/`** (not 3000 — see Open Thread 4), page HTML contains "Ajniha — project shell" and the shadcn `Button` renders with its full compiled class list.
- `git add -n` confirms `.env.example` is staged and `.env` is not.

**Not verified:**
- The page was checked over HTTP, not in a browser — no visual/RTL confirmation. F02 is the first feature where that matters.
- No dark-mode, mobile, or Arabic-glyph check. Nothing bilingual exists yet.
- Whether TypeScript 7 or ESLint 10 work with this stack — deliberately not attempted; the framework pins `^5` and `^9`.

**Next session should know (F02 — i18n & RTL):**
- Run `pnpm typecheck`, **not** `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`, or you'll chase a phantom `LayoutProps` error.
- `src/app/layout.tsx` is still the untouched scaffold and `src/app/page.tsx` is a throwaway placeholder — replace both freely.
- `src/lib/format.ts` does **not** exist yet. It is the only file exempt from the Intl ban; the exemption is keyed to that exact path in `eslint.config.mjs`. Creating it elsewhere means fighting the linter.
- `src/lib/airspace/` does not exist yet either. The purity rule already covers it, and exempts exactly `src/lib/airspace/query.ts`.
- Port 3000 belongs to another app on this machine. Confirm which port `next dev` actually took before trusting a URL.
- Nothing is committed yet at the time of writing — the first commit of this session includes the whole shell.
